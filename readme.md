# SmartBridge AI Externship Repository

Welcome to my SmartBridge AI Externship Repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub for all the knowledge, code, and projects I will accumulate during my ongoing SmartBridge Externship in Artificial Intelligence. Here, I will organize, showcase, and share my work with fellow externs, mentors, and the wider AI community.


## Introduction

As part of my SmartBridge AI Externship, I plan to embark on a journey of learning and exploration in the field of Artificial Intelligence. This repository will provide a space to store and showcase my progress, projects, and code.

## Project Directory

- **/knowledge**: This directory contains markdown files where I will document my learnings, including notes, summaries, and explanations of AI concepts, techniques, and algorithms.

- **/projects**: Here, I will organize my practical projects.

- **/code**: This directory is dedicated to reusable code snippets, scripts, and utility functions I will develop during this externship.
